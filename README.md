## How It Works

### Daily Challenge Mode
- Uses the current date as a seed for consistent song selection
- All users get the same song on the same day
- New song automatically selected at midnight

### Practice Mode
- Randomly selects songs from the artist's iTunes catalog
- New song for each game
- Unlimited play sessions

### Audio Progression
- 1st try: 1 second
- 2nd try: 2 seconds
- 3rd try: 4 seconds
- 4th try: 7 seconds
- 5th try: 10 seconds
- 6th try: 15 seconds

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Modern utility-first CSS framework

## API Endpoints

### Artist-Specific Endpoints
- `GET /api/[artist]/daily` - Get today's daily song for specific artist
- `GET /api/[artist]/random` - Get a random song for specific artist  
- `GET /api/[artist]/songs` - Get all available songs for specific artist

### General iTunes Endpoints

## iTunes Search API

This project uses Apple's free iTunes Search API which provides:

- **No API key required** - Completely free to use
- **30-second preview URLs** - High-quality audio previews
- **Rich metadata** - Song titles, albums, artists, artwork
- **Excellent K-pop coverage** - Including TWICE's full catalog
- **No rate limiting** - For reasonable usage patterns

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Search**: The app searches iTunes for artist tracks on first use
2. **Preview URLs**: Each track includes a 30-second preview URL
3. **Native Audio**: Uses HTML5 audio for reliable playback with custom controls
4. **Caching**: Results are cached for better performance
5. **Multi-Artist Support**: Dynamic routing supports multiple K-pop artists
