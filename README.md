## How It Works

### Daily Challenge Mode
- Uses the current date as a seed for consistent song selection
- All users get the same song on the same day
- New song automatically selected at midnight

### Practice Mode
- Randomly selects songs from TWICE's iTunes catalog
- New song for each game
- Unlimited play sessions

### Audio Progression
- 1st try: 1 second
- 2nd try: 2 seconds
- 3rd try: 4 seconds
- 4th try: 8 seconds
- 5th try: 15 seconds
- 6th try: 15 seconds

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **iTunes Search API** - Free music data and 30-second previews
- **HTML5 Audio API** - Native browser audio playback
- **React Hooks** - State management and side effects

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/itunes/daily` - Get today's daily song
- `GET /api/itunes/random` - Get a random TWICE song
- `GET /api/itunes/songs` - Get all available TWICE songs

## iTunes Search API

This project uses Apple's free iTunes Search API which provides:

- **No API key required** - Completely free to use
- **30-second preview URLs** - High-quality audio previews
- **Rich metadata** - Song titles, albums, artists, artwork
- **Excellent K-pop coverage** - Including TWICE's full catalog
- **No rate limiting** - For reasonable usage patterns

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Search**: The app searches iTunes for TWICE tracks on first use
2. **Preview URLs**: Each track includes a 30-second preview URL
3. **Native Audio**: Uses HTML5 audio for reliable playback
4. **Caching**: Results are cached for better performance
