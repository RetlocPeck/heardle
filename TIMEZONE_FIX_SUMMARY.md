# Timezone Fix Summary

## Problem
The original implementation had a critical timezone issue where daily song selection could vary by ±1 day depending on the user's timezone. This happened because:

1. **`new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]`** was used throughout the codebase
2. **`toISOString()`** converts local time to UTC, which can shift the date by one day
3. Users in different timezones could get different songs on the same calendar day

## Solution
Updated all date handling to use **local timezone consistently** instead of UTC conversion.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/lib/utils/dateUtils.ts`
- **`getTodayString()`**: Now uses `getFullYear()`, `getMonth()`, `getDate()` instead of `toISOString()`
- **`getDateString()`**: Same fix for consistency
- **`parseDateString()`**: Creates dates at local midnight instead of UTC
- **Added new utility functions**:
  - `getNextDayString()`: Get tomorrow's date
  - `getPreviousDayString()`: Get yesterday's date
  - `isTodayInLocalTimezone()`: Robust local timezone checking
  - `getCurrentLocalTime()`: Current local time for debugging
  - `getTimeUntilMidnight()`: Time until next local midnight

### 2. `src/lib/services/dailyChallengeStorage.ts`
- Updated to use `getTodayString()` and `isTodayInLocalTimezone()` from dateUtils
- Ensures consistent local timezone handling for saved game states

### 3. `src/app/api/[artist]/daily/route.ts`
- Updated to use `getTodayString()` instead of `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]`
- Ensures API returns songs based on local timezone date

### 4. `src/app/[artist]/page.tsx`
- Updated to use `getTodayString()` for event dispatching
- Maintains consistency across the entire application

### 5. `src/lib/itunes.ts`
- Enhanced logging in `getDailySong()` method
- Added confirmation that local timezone dates are used

## How It Works Now

### Daily Song Selection
1. **Client-side**: `getTodayString()` gets the current date in user's local timezone
2. **API Route**: Uses the same local timezone date for song selection
3. **Storage**: Saves and loads game states based on local timezone dates
4. **Consistency**: All users in the same timezone get the same song on the same day

### Midnight Behavior
- **Song changes at local midnight**: When the user's local clock hits 00:00:00
- **No more UTC conversion**: Dates are handled entirely in local timezone
- **Predictable timing**: Users can expect new songs exactly at their local midnight

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Experience**: All users in the same timezone get the same daily song
2. **Local Midnight**: Songs change exactly when the user expects (at their local midnight)
3. **No Date Shifts**: Eliminates the ±1 day uncertainty caused by UTC conversion
4. **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging shows exactly which dates are being used
5. **Maintainable Code**: Centralized date utilities make future changes easier

## Testing

The fix was tested with a comprehensive test suite that verified:
- Date string formatting (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Local timezone consistency
- Date parsing and comparison
- Next/previous day calculations
- Time until midnight calculations

All tests passed, confirming the fix works correctly.

## Future Considerations

- **Cross-timezone Play**: Users traveling between timezones will get different songs based on their current location
- **Server Deployment**: Server timezone doesn't affect song selection (all dates are client-local)
- **Performance**: No performance impact from the changes
- **Maintenance**: Centralized date utilities make future timezone-related changes easier
